I am a graduate student at [Columbia University](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/){:target="\_blank"}, studying Computer Science with a specialization in Machine Learning.

Prior to this, I worked as a Software Engineer at [Microsoft India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/about/){:target="\_blank"} from 2018-2019 in Cloud and Enterprise, specifically [Azure Backup](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-overview){:target="\_blank"}. I completed my Bachelor's in Computer Science from [Delhi Technological University](http://dtu.ac.in/){:target="\_blank"} in May 2018.

I am broadly interested in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Software Engineering. I am also a vocal supporter for Women in Technology.
