I am excited to be attending Grace Hopper Celebration 2020 as a Hopper Volunteer!

I have previously worked as the Director of Women Who Code Delhi, where I led a team of females to support more women in technology by organizing large scale events such as hackathons.

I have also been awarded the Google Women Techmaker Scholarship (2017) for my contributions towards inclusion in tech.
